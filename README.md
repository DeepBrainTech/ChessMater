ChessMater is a puzzle game that combines classic chess movement with platformer-style mechanics. Each chess piece moves according to its normal rules, but gravity, obstacles, and special tiles completely change how you approach the board. Guide your pieces through shifting puzzles, avoid traps, unlock objectives, and reach the goal before your moves run out.

Features:

♟️ Authentic Chess Movement – every piece moves just like in real chess.

🌍 Gravity & Physics – pieces fall and interact with the board environment.

🟩 Special Blocks – transformer tiles, objectives, and counter goals add unique challenges.

🎯 Puzzles & Levels – solve creative boards where strategy meets spatial reasoning.

✨ Win Conditions – only one piece needs to reach the goal, but planning your path is everything.
